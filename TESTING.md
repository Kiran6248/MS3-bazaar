#### **Bug Found and Resolved**

1. The Hero image is added through the style sheet because when I was trying to add it through materialize img tag, 
the page was becoming very difficult to resize. As **img** tag is not there in HTML, I didn't add **alt**, instead I added **title** in the containing **div** after referring 
from Stack Overflow.

The Stack Overflow source can be verified here.[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4216035/css-background-image-alt-attribute)
